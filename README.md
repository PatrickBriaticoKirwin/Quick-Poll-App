# Quick-Poll-App
A simple Poll app made in Rails with the help of Grok 3 I don't know if rails of Grok made the creation of it easy, but this was incredibly simple to put together. 
The only stumbling blocks were some of the shadcn components not playing nice with the AI slop code, but other AI tools I've used solve that problem (lovable for example)
It works though!
